# data-structures

This repository is a collection of advanced data structures implemented across various libraries, focusing on linked lists, Merkle trees, and tries. Each data structure is implemented in two distinct styles: Aiken and Plutarch, providing a comprehensive study on different implementation methodologies.

This project includes several submodules, each pointing to a specific implementation of a data structure. Below are the links to the projects included as submodules:

## Linked List Implementations

- **Aiken Linked List**: A linked list implementation using the Aiken methodology.

- **Plutarch Linked List**: A linked list implementation using the Plutarch.
  - [plutarch-linked-list](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/plutarch-linked-list)

## Merkle Tree Implementations

- **Plutarch Merkle Tree**: A Merkle tree data structure implemented with Plutarch.
  - [plutarch-merkle-tree](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/plutarch-merkle-tree)

- **Aiken Merkle Tree**: A Merkle tree structure designed following the Aiken methodology.

## Trie Implementations

- **Plutarch Trie**: A trie (prefix tree) implementation utilizing Plutarch.
